Run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the main program as follows:

```bash
python main.py
```

When you execute python main.py, the program will output a CSV file to the console. You can copy and save this output or further process it as needed.
